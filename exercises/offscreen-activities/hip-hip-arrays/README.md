# ["HIP", "HIP"]

## OVERVIEW

#### Learning Objective

* Understand how each array method works
* Use post-its to re-structure arrays
* Use post-its to create new arrays

#### Materials

* Post-Its
* Pens
* Index Cards

#### Instructions

* Students will need to break up into teams (or pairs if small class size)
* Students will be given an index card with an array method challenge.
* Depending on the teams array method, each team may need to restructure the current post-it array.
* Every team member must answer at least one of their given challenges.

#### Challenges

Use the following array to solve each challenge:

`var hipHipArray = ["Hippo", "Hipster", "Hipbone", "Hippie", "Hippocampus", "Hopping", "Hero", "Hipline", "Hippogriff", "Hipshot"];`

---

**pop() and reverse()**

* Explain what the pop method does
* Using the pop method, what is the the value that will be returned?
* Was the array modified?
* What does the array look like now?
* Explain what the reverse method does
* Using the reverse method what does the array look like now?

---

**slice( _start, end_ )**

* Explain what the slice method does
* Using the slice method, please remove all elements in the array that do not start with `Hip`
* After slicing, what does the return value look like?
* Was the original array modified?

---

**splice( _index, howMany[optional]_ )**

* Explain what the splice method does
* Using the splice method-- if given 2 as the first parameter and 3 as the second parameter, which element(s) will be returned?
* Was the array modified?
* What does the array look like now?

---

**push() and sort()**

* Explain what the push method does
* Using the push method add `Hips` to the array
* Does push modify the array?
* What does the array look like now?
* Explain what the sort method does
* Using the sort method what does the array look like now?

---

**shift() and unshift()**

* Explain what the shift method does
* Using the shift method what is the value that will be returned?
* Explain what the unshift method does
* Using the unshift method add `Hippodrome` to the array
* What does the array look like?
* Was the array modified?
